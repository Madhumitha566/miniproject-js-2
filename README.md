* **Data Persistence:** Uses **Local Storage** to save all entries, ensuring data remains available across browser sessions.
* **Dynamic Filtering:** Easily switch between displaying **All**, **Income**, or **Expense** entries using radio button filters.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive, providing an excellent user experience on both **desktop** and **mobile devices**.
